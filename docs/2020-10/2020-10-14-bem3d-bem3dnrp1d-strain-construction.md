# Title : ylic133 and ylic136 transformation with bem3d::NAT 

## Date

14102020-

## Objective

- To construct the bem3d strain to measure in SATAY. 
- To construct the bem3dnrp1d strain to measure in SATAY.
- To be able to measure how bem1 interactors change with the genetic environment.
    - e=f(dbem3dnrp1**dbem1**)-f(**dbem1**)|dbem3f(**dnrp1**)|dbem3
- To test in satay if the fitness of nrp1 in dbem3 background is equal to fitness of bem3 in dnrp1 background. 

## Method
- Extract the DNA from yll138a: bem3::NAT W303 
  - 15102020 (at 10:30) Inoculate some colonies from a plate in YPD+NAT media (it also has 6xADE).
  - 16102020: DNA extraction 
- Do a PCR with primerset: bem3-upstream/bem3-downstream
- Transform ylic133 and ylic136 with the PCR product. 

## Results
