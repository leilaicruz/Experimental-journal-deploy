# Title: ylic132  transformation with the OEP2 (unsuccesful)

# Date
26062019
# Objective
To remove the ura3 gene from ylic132= ade2- ura3+ by inserting an empty sequence in the ade2 locus , where the ura3 gene is in ylic132.

# Method
[Yeast transformation protocol](C:\Users\linigodelacruz\Documents\PhD_2018\Documentation\SATAY\URA_transformation_in_the_ADE_locus_032019\Protocol_PCR.pdf)

 > I used in this case 150ml of overnight culture.

## Homology arms:
* left homology arm: 252 bp
  > PCR of primer_1_new_upstream_forward and primer_7_upstream
* right homology arm: 271 bp
  > PCR of primer_6_new_downstream_reverse_NO_Rga1 and primer_8_downstream

## DNA concentration
4 ug
## starting OD
OD=1.8

## Selection plates
- **-URA + 2x ADE** (for ylic132 negative control- no transformed cells )
- **-URA + 2x ADE** for a positive control using yll3a with a URA plasmid I received from Ramon.
- **5FOA plates + 2x ADE** , in which only cells lacking URA3 are capable of grow. (positive control for the transformed cells)

# Results
**No growth in 5FOA plates on 17062019**

Explanation: **I did not do the recovery step required when transforming with a dominant marker. The cells before plating need to be in YPD for at least 2 hours and then plating on the selection plate, in thi s case 5FOA.**  [Look here](https://openwetware.org/wiki/McClean:Yeast_Transformation)
