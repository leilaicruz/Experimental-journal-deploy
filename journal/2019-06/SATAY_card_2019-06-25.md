##What is the question?

Main question:

**Are the reproducible genetic backgrounds acquired during evolutionary adaptation after crippling cell polarization showing a recovery of essential genes, towards the "unperturbed" genotype?**

Subquestions:
- To what extent are the essential and non essential genes changing across genetic backgrounds, such that it can be used as observable for the global genetic interaction network "state"?



##Why is it hard? / why it has not being solved before?


 The main challenge in this question is how to map the yeast genome to search for essential and non essential genes in a systematic manner.
 So far, what that have been used for measuring the essential genes of yeast genome are chemical mutagenesis methods, homologous recombination strategies, dCas9- based gene repression, among others. Most of them are tedious and  incomplete for analysing the whole genome.



## What would be my approach?

Recently, a technique called Saturated transposition in yeast tackle this problem in a highly efficient way. The main principle is to saturate the yeast genome with independent insertions of the miniDs transposon. Deep-sequencing of the transposon-genome junctions allows to identify essential and non essential genomic loci.
Since, the cells that happen to have a transposition event on an essential genomic loci wont grow, we wont have them on the sequencing library, hence those regions in the sequencing library will be devoid of transposon insertions.
