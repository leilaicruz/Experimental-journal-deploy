# Checking the homology arms of yll3a strain around the ade2 gene.

![](../images/ade2_sequencing_Map.png)

### Results
- The homology arms seem to have 100% alignment with the ade2 gene sequence uploaded to SGD. (:))
- The primers used were not enough to cover the whole gene (:()


# Design of new primers, for the right homology arm, for transformation that avoid the overlap with the RGA1 gene.

### Issues :(:
The right homology arm was overlaping 203bp of the RGA1 gene. In total it has 3024bp. Perhaps this fact was hindering the succesful integration of the URA gene on the ADE2 locus.
