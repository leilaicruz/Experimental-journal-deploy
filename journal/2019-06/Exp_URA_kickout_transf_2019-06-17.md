# Title: Yeast transformation with the OEP2

# Date
14062019
# Objective
To remove the ura3 gene from ylic132= ade2- ura3+ by inserting an empty sequence in the ade2 locus , where the ura3 gene is in ylic132.

# Method
[Yeast transformation protocol](C:\Users\linigodelacruz\Documents\PhD_2018\Documentation\SATAY\URA_transformation_in_the_ADE_locus_032019\Protocol_PCR.pdf)

## Homology arms:
* left homology arm: 252 bp
  > PCR of primer_1_new_upstream_forward and primer_7_upstream
* right homology arm: 271 bp
  > PCR of primer_6_new_downstream_reverse_NO_Rga1 and primer_8_downstream

## DNA concentration
7ul of 600 ng/ul OEP2 = 4.2 ug

## Selection plates
- **-URA + 3x ADE** (for ylic132 positive control- no transformed cells ) and for the transformed cells as a negative control
- **5FOA plates + 3x ADE** , in which only cells lacking URA3 are capable of grow. (positive control for the transformed cells)

# Results
**No growth in 5FOA plates on 17062019** ðŸ˜•

**Patterned growth of pink and yellow colonies in the -URA +3xADe2 plates**

# Next steps

- [ ] Prepare more OEP2 to have more concentration to transform.
- [ ] Repeat the transformation.
