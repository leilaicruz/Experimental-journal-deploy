# Title : Byk832 transformation using pBK549 plasmid

# Date

10072019

# Objective
 - To insert into the genome the PbK49 plasmid, see [previous attempts of transformation](C:\Users\linigodelacruz\Documents\PhD_2018\Documentation\Experimental_Journal\journal\2019-06/2019-06-20_Exp_Byk832_transformation_pbk549.md)
 - To see if changing the protocol of transformation, from Biotech, by using an exponential growing culture, give better results.

# Method

- To ensure an exponential growing culture I incubated Byk832 the 08072019 by morning
- Dilute 1000x times 09072019 afternoon to a final volume of 10 ml
- Use the overnight culture in 10072019 which had an OD of 1,4.
- I diluted again to an OD of 0.2 in 10ml media volume at 9:00
-
