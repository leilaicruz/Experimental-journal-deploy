# Title : ylic132_1 and ylic132_2  transformation with the OEP2

# Date
11072019

# Objective
To kickout the ura3 gene from the ade2 locus

# Method
- I inoculated 100ml of cells of both strains on Monday 08072019
- On Wednesday morning (10072019) I diluted the saturated cultures 10^5x times, 1ul in 100ml YPD.
- Today, morning, 11072019, strangely, ylic132_1 was really dense with OD of 16 and ylic132_2 not dense at all, with OD=0.6 ðŸ¤”
- I diluted ylic132_1 , 80x to approximately OD of 0.2 and I didnt dilte ylic132_2, just add 2x ADE, which means 200ul of 1000x concentrated stock to a 100ml culture.
## Homology arms:
* left homology arm: 252 bp
  > PCR of primer_1_new_upstream_forward and primer_7_upstream
* right homology arm: 271 bp
  > PCR of primer_6_new_downstream_reverse_NO_Rga1 and primer_8_downstream

## DNA concentration

## Recovery Step - Essential for plating in selective 5FOA plates

## Selection plates
- **-URA + 3x ADE** (for ylic132 positive control- no transformed cells ) and for the transformed cells as a negative control
- **5FOA plates + 3x ADE** , in which only cells lacking URA3 are capable of grow. (positive control for the transformed cells)
