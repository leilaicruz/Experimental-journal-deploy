At the molecular level, these properties emerge from interactions between protein-substrate and protein-protein interactions. The basis for the interactions that occur in a cell, and thereby the properties that a cell has, lies in the genome: genes encode which proteins are present and which activities they can and cannot perform. Thus, each gene can be considered as a node in a large interaction network that directly or indirectly interacts with several other nodes of the network. Interestingly, this interaction network has the ability to compensate for the loss of nodes only by rewiring existing connections without the need to gain new nodes.\nA previously studied evolutionary trajectory shows a reproducible set of mutations bringing a crippled yeast cell to a complete functional cell. The functional damage caused by the  initial mutation was restored by the deletion of three more genes, shown in an experimental evolution study. Moreover, if we genetically engineer a strain with all these mutations we see the same recovery, without the need, though, of the experimental evolution. Taking a closer look to the functional role of the rest of the genes that restore the functional state of the cell, we see that most of them are closely functionally related .")]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"research-questions"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#research-questions"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Research questions:")]),e._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[e._v("Is there a hidden/unknown logic of re-connections in order to maintain the initial architecture of the network?")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("Is there a way to propose based on which gene interacts with which, how the organism can recover  from an initial damage to  its initial wild type phenotype through genetic mutations?, in other words: How can we predict recovery trajectories upon an initial deleterious mutation, based on the genetic interaction network of the organism?")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("How to build potential functional networks associated with unknown proteins?")])]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"goal"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#goal"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Goal:")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Our goal is:")]),e._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[a("p",[e._v("to use machine learning to see if we can find patterns in experimental datasets that will allow us to predict which network components are the most likely to compensate for the loss of a node.")])]),e._v(" "),a("li",[a("p",[e._v("Identifying patterns of genome-wide reorganizations after network perturbations in S. cerevisiae")])])]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"how-could-machine-learning-help-in-answering-those-questions-s"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#how-could-machine-learning-help-in-answering-those-questions-s"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" How could machine-learning help in answering those questions(s)?")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Developing machine learning methods to tackle our questions will be very powerful.
